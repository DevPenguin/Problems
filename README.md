1. Write a native C++ program that allows an unlimited number of values to be entered and stored in an array allocated in the free store. The program should then output the values, five to a line, followed by the average of the values entered. The initial array size should be five elements. The program should create a new array with five additional elements, when necessary, and copy values from the old array to the new.
